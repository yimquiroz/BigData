Pearson's correlation.

1-.What is it?
It is a test that measures the statistical relationship between two continuous variables. If the association between the elements is not linear, then the coefficient is not adequately represented.

2-.Features
Pearson's correlation coefficient can take values ​​between -1 and 1.
The correlation of a variable with itself is always equal to 1.
The value 0 indicates absence of linear covariation, but NOT if the covariation is non-linear.
3-.Advantage
The value is independent of whatever unit is used to measure the variables.
If the sample is large, the accuracy of the estimate is more likely.
4-.Disadvantages
The two variables need to be measured at a continuous quantitative level.
The distribution of the variables must be similar to the normal curve.
Formula used
Pearson's correlation coefficient is defined by the following expression:
That is, the Pearson correlation coefficient refers to the mean of the cross products of the standardized scores of X and Y. This formula has some properties that make it preferable to others. To operate with standardized scores is a scale-free index of measurement. On the other hand, its value oscillates, as already indicated, in absolute terms, between 0 and 1.
